# CASECHECK Coding Challenge

* This is a Ruby on Rails API

* In order to utilize this API you must have the latest version of Ruby and Rails installed. I recommend using the Ruby Version Manager (RVM) to download Ruby and Rails if you have not done so already. 

* You should create a PostgreSQL database called casecheck_development for development testing of this API. Should you wish to alter the database name or other specifics related to the database do so in the config/database.yml file.
